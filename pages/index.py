Layout in Bootstrap is controlled using the grid system. The Bootstrap grid has 
twelve columns.

There are three main layout components in dash-bootstrap-components: Container, 
Row, and Col.

The layout of your app should be built as a series of rows of columns.

We set md=4 indicating that on a 'medium' sized or larger screen each column 
should take up a third of the width. Since we don't specify behaviour on 
smaller size screens Bootstrap will allow the rows to wrap so as not to squash 
the content.

            ## Who's going to vote?

            This app presents a theoretically generalizable model to predict turnout among registered voters based on their publicly available prior voting record and demographic information. This model is based on data from Somerset County, New Jersey, and it predicts individualsâ€™ turnout in the 2017 general election.

            You can explore the model by seeing how the probability of an individual voting rises and falls as you change their characteristics.
